The XYZ; Hey, Chief!
The XYZ; I'm sure you know this but making XYZs requires 5 Xs, Ys, Zs each.
The XYZ; When there is not enough items you should put me to sleep so that I won't waste my energy.
The XYZ; Oh! But don't forget to wake me up! I'm THE only XYZ robot in factory after all.
You can put a robot to sleep by clicking the sleep icon on its window.
Robots that are asleep use less energy so remember to put robots to sleep when they are not needed.
